This post is incomplete. 

Python is arguably one of the most flexable languages at our disposal. Whether you come from a functional background or object orientated background, you will definitely find a home in Python. In this post, we will be discussing the object orientated approach to Python. This will be extended in further posts to see how class inheritance and abstract classes can be used to simplify your coding workflow. After this post, you will know:
1) What object orientated programming is and why it is used
2) How to define and use classes in Python

### Object Orientated Programming
A formal definition of Object Orientated Programming (OOP) is that it is a programming style where the developer aims to define different data types and structures, i.e. objects, and the operations that can be applied to it. This statement can do with some unpacking! To start off
